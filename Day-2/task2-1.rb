# Determine why multiple inheritance is not supported in ruby(what is mixin)
"..
Ruby does not support Multiple Inheritance.
Ruby uses Mixin instead.

what is mixin?

- The mixins are designed to implement multiple inheritances in Ruby, but it only inherits the interface part. 
- Mixins are an alternative class design pattern that avoids both single-inheritance class fragmentation and multiple-inheritance diamond dependencies. 
- A mixin is a class that defines and implements a single, well-defined feature. 
- Subclasses that inherit from the mixin inherit this featureâ€”and nothing else.
