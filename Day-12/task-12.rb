Q1 Write a query that will return all authors with the count of all their books
Author.joins(:books).group("authors.name").count("books.author_id")

SELECT COUNT("books"."author_id") AS "count_books_author_id", "authors"."name" AS "authors_name" FROM "authors" INNER JOIN "books" ON "books"."author_id" = "authors"."id" GROUP BY "authors"."name"

 => {"J.K. Rowling"=>2, "William Shakespeare"=>2} 


Q2 Write a query to get the count of authors who have published at least one book.
Author.includes(:books).where(books: { published: true }).count

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT "authors"."id") FROM "authors" LEFT OUTER JOIN "books" ON "books"."author_id" = "authors"."id" WHERE "books"."published" = ?  [["published", 1]]
 
=> 2

Q9 Write a query to get the books which reviews contains a "nice"

Q10 Note down difference between joins and includes
Includes
Performs outer left join and store the associated result in memory.
Sometimes generate one query and sometimes generates 2 queries.
If you want to force to use a single query you can add .references
Joins
Only affects the SQL query
doesnâ€™t load related data into memory

Q11 Try different types of joins
Left join
Book.left_joins(:reviews)

SELECT "books".* FROM "books" LEFT OUTER JOIN "reviews" ON "reviews"."book_id" = "books"."id" 

Inner join
Book.joins(:reviews)

 SELECT "books".* FROM "books" INNER JOIN "reviews" ON "reviews"."book_id" = "books"."id"                                                   

Author.joins('INNER JOIN books ON books.author_id = authors.id')

 SELECT "authors".* FROM "authors" INNER JOIN books ON books.author_id = authors.id

left outer join
Book.left_outer_joins(:reviews)

  SELECT "books".* FROM "books" LEFT OUTER JOIN "reviews" ON "reviews"."book_id" = "books"."id"
