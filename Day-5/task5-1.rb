# 1) Difference between strptime and strftime:
'''
Strptime : str points to time
Strftime : string from time
strptime means string parser, this will convert a string format to datetime. 
strftime means string formatter, this will format a datetime object to string format.
 The strptime function converts characters to time objects. 
The strftime function converts time objects to characters.

# 2) Difference between Loops and Iterators:
'''
Loop refers to the code... iteration refers to the process in which the content of loop is executed once.. so 1 iteration refers to 1 time execution of loop.. so basically one loop can undergo many iterations.
Loop is used for fixed no. of element or certain condition occurs while iterator is used for iterating elements dynamically that have different no. of elements at runtime.
Iteration is simply the number of time/times a loop can be executed, while loop is the code which generates or causes expressions to be iterated when the loop is executing.

# 3) Difference between Each and Collect:
'''
each returns the enumerable itself while #collect returns the array having the results of the block execution for each element of the enumerable.
